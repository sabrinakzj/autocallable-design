# Autocallable Structured Product Design & Pricing Engine

This project implements a complete workflow—from market data fetching and Monte Carlo simulation to Greeks calculation and dynamic delta hedging backtesting. Designed for coursework reference.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- **Dual Pricing Models**: Supports both classic **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** and the more market-realistic **Heston stochastic volatility model** for easy comparison.
- **Full Risk Metrics**: Computes **Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho** with intuitive risk interpretations.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Flexibly adjust volatility, interest rates, barrier levels, etc., to observe impacts on fair value and knock-out/in probabilities.
- **Dynamic Hedging Backtest**: Simulates the issuer's delta-hedging process, comparing **daily** vs. **weekly** rebalancing strategies in terms of cost and tracking error.
- **Automated Termsheet Generation**: Produces professional **TXT** and **PDF** product term sheets directly from pricing results.
- **Visual Outputs**: Automatically generates key charts including price paths, payoff distributions, and hedging performance.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabrinakzj/autocallable-design.git
cd autocallable-design```

**### 2. Run the Main Program**
python main.py

## The program will sequentially:
Fetch the latest Hang Seng Index price
Run pricing under both GBM and Heston models
Compute Greeks and scenario analysis
Generate charts and term sheets
Execute delta hedging backtest

**## Generated Termsheet**

outputs.pdf will include:
Product summary and payoff mechanism
Key definitions
Pricing results and Greeks
Scenario analysis table
